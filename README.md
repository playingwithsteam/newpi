Super rough draft of quick tuning and preperation of a new RPI3B+

The idea of the scripts is, to assume you're on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and using a good quality high speed memory card that can handle overclocking.
Overclocks the card reader, reboots, runs updates, installs some basic educational apps, etc.

This stuff could technically ruin everything so I'd suggest nobody try using it. ;)

If you do, make sure you have backups. Make sure your memory card can handle it. In theory it's possible to ruin cheaper memory cards though.
